Flesch Kincaid score is not the best estiator when:

It tends to appear almost tought-like: short sentences, simple words, easy language, so Flesch Kincaid may estimate this texts as easy, However, among humans it is considered one of the most hard-to-read styles due to its inconsistency and abstarctness
 2. Specialized texts. If the text is supposed to be read by an audience with a high level of expertise,  Flesch-Kincaid score might  not be an appropriate estimator. It may label such texts as difficult, when in reality this text’s target audience find it easy,

Part 2 Task G.
The custom_tokenizer function  does the following lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, whitespace normalization,length filtering, number filtering.
Performance:
Custom tokenizer generally was not better than default one:
F1-score decreased from 0.78 to 0.75;
Accuracy dropped from 0.83 to 0.82;
Nevertheless, we still have quite good performance (F1 = 0.75) and less overfitting on ‘Conservative’ (precision 0.84 vs 0.85). the perfomance between classes generally is more balanced as well
